# CISC2200 Spring 2024 Lab3

In this lab assignment, we practice **working with dynamic array**, **working with class template**,
and **understanding testcases**.

## Download starter code

From your terminal (mac or WSL/Ubunto) window, you can use the following command to download it:
```
git clone https://github.com/CISC2200-Spring2024/lab3.git
```

## Programming Environment Setup
If you haven't done so already, please set up programming environment our our own computer, by following [Setup Tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/). 

- The _Commannd Line Tools_ are required. 

- The _C++ Dev Environment_ (VSCode) is highly recommened.

**Please follow these tutorials closely and carefully.**

## Requirements:

Please implement the following member functions in the **AList.h**. 

1. Implement  **addFirst** member function 
2. Implement **getFirst()** member function
3. Implement **removeFirst()**  member function
4. Implement the copy constructor, note that you need to perform deep-copy
5. (Extra credits:) Overload the assignment operator (i.e., copy assignment). 
   
## Hints

The **main.cpp** provided in this repository tests the above member functions and checks to see if the returned value or the list is changed as 
expected by the function. 

You can modify the file **main.cpp** anyway you wish 
in order to test your member functions. You should take an incremental approach: 


## Submission 

Submit your **AList.h** file at the following link by xxxx, midnight (11:59pm). The autograder compiles and tests your programs using 
some testcases that are different from those in **main.cpp**. If your program fails some testcases, go back to review your code, and test your member functions
with different inputs.
